# Notice

This is a fork of the original [Javabuilders](https://github.com/jacek99/javabuilders) project.

I am not going to maitain or add new features to it, I just tried to fix the `illegal reflective access`
problems related to jdk9 module system. It seems to work right now without any warning but I can't say for sure because
the project use reflection a lot.

You can read the [Original README](Original_README.md).
